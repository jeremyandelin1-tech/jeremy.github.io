	<P>The most insightful way to get to know me would be to intertwine yourself with my musical intrests as a bit of a precursor to the way I behave and my life philosophys. I'll also probably have to just hop in a few of my favorite TV shows for added context.</p>

<h2>Unwise Words About Me</h2>

<p>	
In regards to the inquiry into an academic history pertinent to myself, perhaps first noting I attended a few semesters up at Weber State and pursued an Automotive Technicians Certification through the Ogden Weber Applied Technology College in my hometown and current residence Ogden, Utah. As of recent in attendance here at Salt Lake Community College I have decided to pursue a career in the technology sector through a degree in Computer Science. I believe this class has the opportunity to both help me authenticate my personal ideas through a more accurate and in depth sense of communication amongst both my peers, teachers, and future interactions out in the job market. 

	My current home in Ogden is a place I feel comfortable either reading on the patio or wrenching in the garage on whatever has decided to showcase its unreliability. This summer has been a bit of a rocky run, pondering through the best sellers list as I have spent a lot of unfortunate time pillaging through underdeveloped over simplified character designs and clean neat “Micheal Bay” flavored happy endings through books like the Deadly Cross. Or overly uninspired and overindulgent toward the introspective writer's perspective beat to death in The Magpie Murders. The solace always comes from going with old reliable and meandering toward Chuck Palahniuk in “Invisible Monsters” or my favorite dystopian style where I finally got around to reading “A Brave New World”. In my telling of my more current literary escapades I hope to evoke some sorts of book recommendations to supplement this course.

	As far as  concerns I may hold for the course I only hope to be able to hold some sort of an ongoing discourse with the professor to assist in some sort of positive development in my less than admirable writing style. I would be more than open to an ongoing dissection of the way I present my ideas and perhaps a way to make my messages more decisive and therefore effective. Personally I think based on your sprinkling of the “Prince of Darkness” and what I believed to be “Zack de La Roca” (though I can’t be certain as you scrolled so quickly passed the photo) throughout the class syllabus and course expectations, I can see us being at least on a musical level able to find some middle ground where we’d be able to develop some meaningful discussion.

	I appreciate the removal of technology in the classroom except as a way to produce a finished product, I appreciate your ideology and do believe that could allow for better group conversation as well as a way to create better cognitive retention through actual engagement. Personally using pen and paper I find recollection much more concrete and ideas communicated from the course more readily available in day to day conversation or communication across the board.

	Looking forward I do have high hopes that this course is able to be positively impactful on the rest of my course load in allotting me better and more intentionally provocative discourse amongst both peers and instructors looking ahead. As stated prior, I’m very open to critique and an ongoing dialogue on ways I appear to be lacking or more likely overcompensating for a disinterest in the subject matter.
