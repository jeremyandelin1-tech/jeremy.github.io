		<p>Here at uncle bens Ratscallion's pizza place we like have somewhat of a certain "je ne sais quoi" that makes you feel as if you should've taken the stairs instead of hopping on that elevator if you know what im talkin about. I miss you by Blinkk 182 is our only vinyl we have playing in the bathroom and unfortunantely its stuckon repeat over that weird section where they start talking about spiders. We had a "Chuck E Cheese" Style mascot that used to do some sort of an act out front but he's out on house arrest for the next few months or so so the pinball machines are kinda our main attraction for the time being. Hope you got your tetnus and flu shots, because, oh well they're just important to have in general. Hope the pies not too cold. Cheers mate!</p>
