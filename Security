Personal security is something I've thought about intermittently, but have never had any kind of interaction with any sort of online threat. Primarily, I believe this can be achieved through the avoidance of "free streaming" software,  various ad manipulations, frequent password changes, changes to emails used for account creation and sign-ups, avoidance of "giveaways", and the use of Google and Apple Pay for payments, thereby reducing the frequency of online card information usage. My online presence, as far as social media, has always been fairly restricted to my skateboarding and snowboarding affiliations to share outdoor content. Ideology and politics stay far from any kind of online banner public broadcast.




Cybersecurity could be more ingrained in my behaviors. I have never looked at various security software or defense systems and have typically just used what came attached with my Mac in the passed and now Windows with my current ThinkPad. I would like to spend some time researching security software and am fairly interested in its operation. As it stands currently, I have little to no knowledge of how the code they write implements protection. I know hackers are an integral part of the process that creates good security. Through the exploitation of weaknesses in software, they alert the programmers of the software and allow for the code to be patched or bolstered against malicious threats. The best defense being a strong offense applies here integrally in the sense that without manifesting potential attacks, cybersecurity cannot create defense mechanisms with the ability to thwart threats on multiple levels, both internally and externally. By developing types of scanners, security walls, and encryption abilities, they are better able to ensure the safety of data from users, consumers, and employees.
